/**
 * It is a simple, real world task. You will receive a single string as input. It will have the month (2 digits) and year(2 or 4 digits). These are separated by one character ("-" or "/", maybe some spaces too). For example:

02/21
02 / 21
02 / 2021
02-2021
Assume that all dates are in the XXI century.

Your task is to write a function that returns true or false if the expiry date is not in the past. Note, current month should still return true.

const checkExpiryValid = (date) => {
