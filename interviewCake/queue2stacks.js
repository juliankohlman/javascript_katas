/**
 * Implement a queue ↴ with 2 stacks. ↴ Your queue should have an enqueue and a dequeue method and it should be "first in first out" (FIFO).
 * Optimize for the time cost of mm calls on your queue. These can be any mix of enqueue and dequeue calls.
 * Assume you already have a stack implementation and it gives O(1)O(1) time push and pop.

// enqueue

// dequeue

// FIFO order

// Have a stack with O(1) push and pop (use built-in array)
