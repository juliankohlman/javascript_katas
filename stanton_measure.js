// The Stanton measure of an array is computed as follows. Count the number of 1s
// in the array. Let this count be n. The Stanton measure is the number of times
// that n appears in the array.

// eg:-

//  TheStantonmeasureof[1,4,3,2,1,2,3,2]is3

//  because 1 occurs 2 times in the array and 2 occurs 3 times. Write a function
// stantonMeasure/StantonMeasure which takes an integer array and returns its
// Stanton measure.
